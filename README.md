# Mapping_Earthquakes
This project is meant to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. The magnitude and location will be represented with color and diameter. Seismic activity and tectonic plates will be plotted out with fault lines. A legend will help the viewer detail the maps different settings and allow for greater interaction.
